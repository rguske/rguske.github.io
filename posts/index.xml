            </div>CCC When you&rsquo;ve read through this short post and you feel encouraged to take a step beyond your comfort zone, then this post and my intention reached its goal.
Community I recently had the pleasure to suppport a really cool guy out of the #VEBA Slack Community, his name is Bob, with his function example contribution to the VMware Event Broker project. On a remote session late at night, at least it was for me due to the different timezones CET 🌕 and EST ☀, Bob introduced his Powershell/ PowerCLI function to me and I was immediately thrilled about what the ƒ(x) does.]]></description>

            </div>Since the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) is reaching more and more folks out there and the interest is growing steadily, it is important to validate the integration with other solutions (preferably VMware). At least that&rsquo;s what I thought 😉.
Monitoring in terms of utilization and performance captured my interest. So, how can I monitor not only the appliance (virtual machine) but also the Kubernetes components like the Control Plane (Master), the Node(s) as well as the Pods?]]></description>

            </div>&hellip;and thus also the Enterprise PKS Management Console (EPMC), which is now inferring named as Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Management Console (TKGIMC).
Quote  &quot;&hellip;VMware is announcing important milestones for key products in the VMware Tanzu portfolio, which brings consistency to building, running, and managing code. VMware is the only company that addresses the challenges of application modernization from both the application and the infrastructure perspective.&quot;

   Referring to this 👆, this rebranding was necessary to unify VMware&rsquo;s Kubernetes offerings under the Tanzu umbrella.]]></description>

            </div>The vCenter Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) is still one of my favorite open source projects these days and it is evolving rapidly and continuously through the great work of the two main contributors Michael Gasch and William Lam as well as through the valuable feedback from the community. I´m very proud to be part of the &ldquo;inner circle&rdquo; of folks who meet on a regular basis to discuss everything #VEBA and the keyword here is also feedback.]]></description>

            </div>I often thought about writing down my experiences on the topics of Jumphosts, Shell-modifications and useful tools in a series of blog posts, but I hadn´t found the right moment, until I saw the following Tweet, where Alex asked his followers how they get access to a Linux system if they aren´t running Linux on their workstation (locally).

            </div>High ⚡ Way to Shell The operationalization of platforms such as e.g. Kubernetes, or the use of tools for building services or applications such as Docker, requires in both cases the use of the command-line. There are dozens of great plugins, themes and extensions out there to pimp your shell so that it´ll help you to increase velocity as well as useability.
Part III of my series is focused on the Shell and which &ldquo;Highway&rdquo; you can take to have the described tool available at the end.]]></description>

            </div>The idea behind this post was born as follows:
Quote  Me: &hellip;it´s on vSphere Central.
Customer: On which site?
Me: vSphere Central! Never heard of it?
Customer: I know Storagehub, but I´ve never heard of vSphere Central.
   This is basically how the conversation went and I told him as well as my TAM peer Tina, she was with me on this session, that I will provide a collection of the VMware Microsites I know, together in a post.]]></description>
