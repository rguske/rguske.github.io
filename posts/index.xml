            </div>I recently had to prepare my homelab for a customer workshop to demo our new Tanzu Runtime &amp; Hybrid Infrastructure Services. This includes e.g. the deployment of a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Cluster on vSphere (TKG Service), the enterprise cloud native registry Harbor as well as the instantiation of a native Pod on vSphere (vSphere Pod Service).
