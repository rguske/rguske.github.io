            </div>Avi Portal - Bad Service Oh my! I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a three-part series as an outcome of my recent homelab crash, but here we are ðŸ˜„ Check out my recent posts Database Resurrection - Reviving vPostgres DB on VMware vCenter Server and Fixing vCenter Postgres Archiver Service - Dead Postgres Replication Slot on my made experiences with recovering the vCenter Server database.
Actually, I thought I was &ldquo;out of the woods&rdquo; with fixiing the broken but unfortunately my Avi Controller was also affected from the outage.]]></description>

            </div>Of course I run Backups ðŸ¤¥ This time I had luck with the outcome of my recent homelab crash. If I weren&rsquo;t able to fix my broken vCenter Server, as described in my previous article, I would have had to reinstall my vSphere (+ vSAN, + Tanzu) environment basically from scratch again.
Is this actually true?
Actually NO! Because if I would have configured my vSphere environment correctly, vCenter Server file-based backup were configured properly and I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to worry about the consequences in the end.]]></description>

            </div>Power Failure causes Problems again Once in a while power failures happen and can (mostly will!) cause troubles for small homelabs like mine. I&rsquo;m running a two-node vSAN cluster on two Supermicro SYS-E200-8D servers. My vSAN Witness Appliance is running on a small Intel NUC, which is perfectly suited for this use case. The vCenter Server is still running on the vSAN cluster but only compute-wise. I have a Synology NAS running as well which is providing an additional NFS datastore in order to have at least the VCSA (VM) storage outsourced from the cluster.]]></description>

            </div>Knative ðŸ’™ In the rapidly evolving landscape of modern software architecture, event-driven systems have emerged as a pivotal paradigm, empowering organizations to create highly responsive, scalable, and adaptable applications. Knative stands at the forefront of this revolution, offering a robust and flexible framework for building event-driven architectures (EDA) that seamlessly integrate diverse components, enhance automation, and enable real-time data processing.
I&rsquo;m evangelizing and supporting the Knative project for a longer time already.]]></description>

            </div>Hybrid Application Architectures As technology advances at a rapid pace, the landscape of application development continues to evolve. The demand for agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness has given rise to a new breed of architectures that seamlessly integrate modern cloud-native principles with established traditional workloads. One such paradigm that has gained significant traction is the hybrid application architecture, which combines the power of service-oriented architectures (SOA) with the reliability and versatility of virtual machines (VMs).]]></description>

            </div>Recap and Intro In Part I and II of my blog series on the Supervisor Services in vSphere with Tanzu (TKG with Supervisor Model), I covered the topics from registering and installing a new service on a Supervisor Cluster until how to leverage a service for functionalities like e.g. hosting container images (Registry Service) or handling incoming traffic (Ingress Service) for vSphere Pod based applications.
Through this part, I&rsquo;d like to bring you the lifecycle of a Supervisor Service a bit closer.]]></description>

            </div>Recap and Intro In Part I of my blog series on the Supervisor Services in vSphere with Tanzu (TKGS), I introduced the overall concept, the idea, the requirements as well as how to register and install a new Supervisor Service in vSphere.

Furthermore, I covered the feature vSphere Pods and how they come to beneficial use for the Supervisor Services.

In this second part, I&rsquo;m going to demonstrate how the Kubernetes Ingress Controller Service (Contour) will be used for serving a vSphere Pod based web-shop application with Ingress functionalities.]]></description>

            </div>To begin with, if you are familiar with vSphere Pods in general, you can skip the first chapter of this post and directly go to the chapter Supervisor Services.
Recap - Embed Containers and Kubernetes into vSphere When VMware released vSphere 7 back in 2020, it was announced that under the hood a lot of architectural efforts flowed into VMware&rsquo;s core platform. These efforts had to be done in order to embed containers and Kubernetes into vSphere, to unify them with virtual machines as first class citizens.]]></description>

            </div>The open-source container registry Harbor supports the configuration of webhook endpoints. Harbor notifies the webhook endpoint of certain events that occur in a project. However, the event sent is not delivered as a CloudEvent. By leveraging the power of VEBA/Knative the non-CloudEvent can be send to a webhook function to get transformed in a CloudEvent. By transforming the event, other functions can be subscribed to the new event to ultimately get triggered. As a use case for it, I'm going to describe how ChatOps can be enabled using event-driven automation.]]></description>
