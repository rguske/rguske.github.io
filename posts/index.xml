            </div>&hellip;and thus also the Enterprise PKS Management Console (EPMC), which is now inferring named as Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Management Console (TKGIMC).
Quote  &quot;&hellip;VMware is announcing important milestones for key products in the VMware Tanzu portfolio, which brings consistency to building, running, and managing code. VMware is the only company that addresses the challenges of application modernization from both the application and the infrastructure perspective.&quot;

            </div>The vCenter Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) is still one of my favorite open source projects these days and it is evolving rapidly and continuously through the great work of the two main contributors Michael Gasch and William Lam as well as through the valuable feedback from the community. I´m very proud to be part of the &ldquo;inner circle&rdquo; of folks who meet on a regular basis to discuss everything #VEBA and the keyword here is also feedback.]]></description>

            </div>I often thought about writing down my experiences on the topics of Jumphosts, Shell-modifications and useful tools in a series of blog posts, but I hadn´t found the right moment, until I saw the following Tweet, where Alex asked his followers how they get access to a Linux system if they aren´t running Linux on their workstation (locally).
 Ubuntu 18.04 VDI desktop

Firefox is pre-installed on Ubuntu as well as on CentOS but I´m for years now with Chrome and I´m still satisfied.]]></description>

            </div>High ⚡ Way to Shell The operationalization of platforms such as e.g. Kubernetes, or the use of tools for building services or applications such as Docker, requires in both cases the use of the command-line. There are dozens of great plugins, themes and extensions out there to pimp your shell so that it´ll help you to increase velocity as well as useability.
Part III of my series is focused on the Shell and which &ldquo;Highway&rdquo; you can take to have the described tool available at the end.]]></description>

            </div>The idea behind this post was born as follows:
Quote  Me: &hellip;it´s on vSphere Central.
Customer: On which site?
Me: vSphere Central! Never heard of it?
Customer: I know Storagehub, but I´ve never heard of vSphere Central.
   This is basically how the conversation went and I told him as well as my TAM peer Tina, she was with me on this session, that I will provide a collection of the VMware Microsites I know, together in a post.]]></description>

            </div>Introduction The deployment of a Virtual Container Host (VCH) can be done in various ways. One easy way is to use the vSphere-Client (H5) plugin which gives you the ability to configure all necessary parameters e.g. for network, storage or deployment target through a step-by-step deployment wizard. The far more efficient variant in my opinion is making use of the vic-machine utility, a Command Line Interface which is part of the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle.]]></description>

   When was the last time that you were so much taken by a topic or better by a combination of several, that just by thinking about it your face is filled with enthusiasm?
For me, it&rsquo;s only been a few days ago and it was in one of these afterwork-calls with my well appreciated colleague and friend Michael Gasch where we talked about things we were working on.]]></description>
