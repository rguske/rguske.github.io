      <description>Based on talks with customers who already made their experiences running containerized applications in test as well as in production and who are using vSphere Integrated Containers for their way to go, I decided to build a dashboard to monitor those workloads (Container-VMs) with VMware´s Cloud Management Solution, vRealize Operations Manager (vR Ops).
 Figure I: VIC monitoring high level overview
The Dashboard Treating Containers as &amp;ldquo;First-Class Citizens&amp;rdquo; is what vSphere Integrated Containers can offer to IT-(Dev)Ops Teams through instantiating a Container-Image as a Virtual Machine.</description>

      <description>Inspired by a recent post from my friend, (Go)Hugo and Git mentor Michael Gasch 😉, where he describes how he fixed the Hugo Shortcode for Twitter to suppress the default thread view, it came to my mind immediately that I faced a similar issue when I started blogging with the Shortcode which embeds a Youtube-Video into your post.
See how Michael fixed the normal behavior for the Twitter Shortcode {{&amp;lt; tweet &amp;gt;}} here&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Upgrade vSphere Integrated Containers</title>

      <description>I like upgrades! Because mostly they bring cool new features with them or eliminate disturbing issues. In this post I´d like to guide you through the upgrade process of VMware vSphere Integrated Containers  from version v1.3.1 to v1.4.1 which is a major upgrade and also to v1.4.3 which is a minor upgrade.
Thanks Tom Schwaller for reviewing this article.
First of all and this applies to all upgrades, we have to check the compatibility and dependencys with our infrastructure components.</description>

      <title>vSphere Integrated Containers Part IV: docker run a Container-VM</title>

      <description>Now that we´ve become more familiar with the Virtual Container Host, it´s time to run our first Container-VM on it. The following example will show you how easy it is to instantiate an Nginx  Web Server container-image.
We first pull down the image from Docker Hub to our Datastore by using docker -H 192.168.100.222:2376 --tls pull vmwarecna/nginx. You´ll see some running tasks in your vCenter taskbar under Recent Tasks. Validate the downloaded image with docker -H 192.</description>

      <title>vSphere Integrated Containers Part III: Deployment of a Virtual Container Host</title>

      <description>In this part I´d like to guide you through the Deployment of a Virtual Container Host aka VCH. I definitely don ́t want to make it a habit to use already written descriptions, but this one described it very well, thus I had like to quote this:
 A VCH is the virtual functional equivalent of a Linux VM running Docker. From a Docker client point of view, the Virtual Container Host looks very similar to a native Docker host.</description>

      <title>vSphere Integrated Containers Part II: vSphere Client Plug-In</title>

      <description>In this section, I´d like to give you a walkthrough on how to install the VIC vSphere Client Plug-In for the vCenter Server Appliance. I´m already using the vCenter Server Appliance aka vCSA in Version 6.7.0. In general, it is important to know that a minimum version of vCenter Server 6.5.0d is required to make use of the plug-in.
However! It is also worth to be mentioned that the plug-in is not necessary or a requirement to run VIC as well as for the deployment of a Virtual Container Host aka VCH.</description>

      <title>VMware vSphere Integrated Containers: Overview</title>

      <description>I´m very keen on everything related to Cloud-Native and all topics around the decoupling of a process from the underlying operating system and as well much more on the infrastructure underneath in order to run those distributed systems, which are the result by the end of the day.
For me personally, it became so present in 2016 for the first time and far more when I decided to work for VMware.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;and the first lines are the main ones when you´re working on your first post. Many, many thoughts had been running through my head before I decided to write a blog…“Where to start?”…“Is it just another blog?”…and the most frightening idea…“What if YOU, the reader, don´t like what I´m writing about?”
So what&amp;hellip;I´d like to handle these thoughts like Tony Stark did it in one of my absolute favorite movies Iron Man (1), where he told J.</description>
