            </div>Introduction You may have already heard and read about our latest changes regarding our Kubernetes offering(s) vSphere with Tanzu also former known as vSphere with Kubernetes. Personally, I was totally excited and full of anticipation to make my first hands-on experience with this new deployment option &ndash;&gt; vSphere Networking as an alternative to NSX-T and how HAProxy is doing it&rsquo;s job within this construct. I don&rsquo;t know how you are dealing with installations of the &ldquo;NEW&rdquo; but I always read the documentation first&hellip; &hellip; not &hellip; 🙊 &hellip; but I should!]]></description>

            </div>Introduction In my previous blog post I took A closer look at VMware&rsquo;s Project Nautilus and went through some of the implementation details (Fusion 12). I described how it provides a single development platform on the desktop by enabling you to run, build and manage OCI compliant Containers as well as how easy it is now to instantiate Kubernetes Clusters besides Virtual Machines.
The question This post is intented to answer a question which came into my mind during my work on VMware&rsquo;s Open Source project VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) and as I&rsquo;ve heard of Project Nautilus for the first time.]]></description>

            </div>I recently had to prepare my homelab for a customer workshop to demo our new Tanzu Runtime &amp; Hybrid Infrastructure Services. This includes e.g. the deployment of a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Cluster on vSphere (TKG Service), the enterprise cloud native registry Harbor as well as the instantiation of a native Pod on vSphere (vSphere Pod Service).

His name is Bob. He introduced his Powershell/ PowerCLI function on a remote session to me and I was immediately thrilled about what the function does. It covers a use case that one of my customers brought up some time ago when I first introduced VEBA to them.]]></description>

            </div>Since the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) is reaching more and more folks out there and the interest is growing steadily, it is important to validate the integration with other solutions (preferably VMware). At least that&rsquo;s what I thought 😉.
Monitoring in terms of utilization and performance captured my interest. So, how can I monitor not only the appliance (virtual machine) but also the Kubernetes components like the Control Plane (Master), the Node(s) as well as the Pods?]]></description>
