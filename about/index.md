I´ve started my journey back in 2016 within VMware´s Professional Service Organization <a href="https://www.vmware.com/professional-services.html" target="_blank">(PSO)</a> as a Technical Account Manager. In case you don´t know exactly what a TAM does, I´d like to forward you to this -> <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/services-education-insights/2017/11/vmware-technical-account-manager.html" target="_blank">post</a> which describes it in perfect words.  

I´m an accomplished, hands-on, & well informed IT professional with 15+ years of experience in providing strategic guidance regarding IT technology and infrastructural enhancements to clients and organizations. I´m very keen on all topics around cloud-native and software-defined-everything and I like to share this passion with you through this blog.
I´m also active on Twitter and you´ll find me under my handle <a href="https://twitter.com/vmw_rguske" target="_blank">@vmw_rguske</a> as well as on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-guske-830853111/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
