## Professional Information
I´m an accomplished, hands-on, & well informed IT professional with 15+ years of experience in providing strategic guidance regarding IT technology and infrastructural enhancements to clients and organizations. I´m very keen on all topics around Cloud-Native Technologies and software-defined-everything and I like to share this passion with you through this blog.

Within VMware´s Professional Service Organization <a href="https://www.vmware.com/professional-services.html" target="_blank">(PSO)</a>, I´ve started my journey back in October 2016 as a Technical Account Manager. In case you don´t know exactly what a TAM does, I´d like to forward you to the following post which describes it very well: [What is a VMware Technical Account Manager?](https://blogs.vmware.com/services-education-insights/2017/11/vmware-technical-account-manager.html)

## Open-Source Contributions
I am very proud to mention that since 2019 I am part of a team of very experienced and engaged VMware folks who, besides their professional role, invest a lot of time and passion in the Open-Source project [VMware Event Broker Appliance](https://vmweventbroker.io). This project provides an event-driven approach to interact with VMware's solutions by using Functions as a Service.

## Certifications

I passed several industry certifications over the years during my career in IT. Basically, all of these are infrastructure focused. If you are interested in which ones exactly, please feel free to have a look at my Linked<i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-fw"></i> profile: [Robert Guske](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-guske-830853111/).

Nevertheless, those are my latest three certifications I've passed:

### vExpert

{{< admonition info "About the program" true >}}
The annual VMware vExpert title is given to individuals who have significantly contributed to the community of VMware users over the past year. The title is awarded to individuals (not employers) for their commitment to sharing their knowledge and passion for VMware technology above and beyond their job requirements.

I am very delighted that I've already been elected into the program several times.
