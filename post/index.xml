      <description>I often thought about writing down my experiences on the topics of Jumphosts, Shell-modifications and useful tools in a series of blog posts, but I hadn¬¥t found the right moment, until I saw the following Tweet, where Alex asked his followers how they get access to a Linux system if they aren¬¥t running Linux on their workstation (locally).
 Ubuntu 18.04 VDI desktop

 A Linux Development Desktop with VMware Horizon - Part I: Horizon  Applications In this section I¬¥m going to list a couple of applications which I¬¥m using for my desktop and how you can easily install them from your shell. Of course, it¬¥s not a must and it¬¥s up to you which of them you¬¥d like to install.
Google Chrome - https://www.google.com/chrome/ Firefox is pre-installed on Ubuntu as well as on CentOS but I¬¥m for years now with Chrome and I¬¥m still satisfied.</description>

      <description>Version 1.5.0 of VMware¬¥s turnkey solution VMware Enterprise PKS, which brings production-grade Kubernetes to enterprises, was released back in August this year. This release introduced the beta (v.0.9) of the VMware Enterprise PKS Management Console (EPMC) which offers an opinionated installation of Enterprise PKS. With the PKS minor release v.1.5.1, the EPMC went GA in version 1.0.0.
Further improvements and enhancements were made in version 1.6 (*1), which went GA on the 26th of November, a few days after the release of Enterprise PKS v.</description>

      <description>In the previous blog post we went through the Day-1 capabilities of the new version of the Enterprise PKS Management Console (EPMC). Let¬¥s have a look at what¬¥s in for Day-2.
Summary Page The summary page of your Enterprise PKS deployment will appear after clicking the Enterprise PKS button at the top left corner. This page will give you an detailed overview of all the PKS Management Plane components including important data like, Service State, Version Numbers, IP addresses and also Hyperlinks either to the relevant Virtual Machine in vSphere or to the Website of an Management-Component like, NSX-T or the Pivotal Ops Manager.</description>

      <description>The idea behind this post was born as follows:
 Me: &amp;hellip;it¬¥s on vSphere Central.
Customer: On which site?
Me: vSphere Central! Never heard of it?
Customer: I know Storagehub, but I¬¥ve never heard of vSphere Central.
 This is basically how the conversation went and I told him and my TAM peer Tina, she was with me on the session, that I will provide a collection of the VMware Microsites I know, together at one point.</description>

      <description>Introduction The deployment of a Virtual Container Host (VCH) can be done in various ways. One easy way is to use the vSphere-Client (H5) plugin which gives you the ability to configure all necessary parameters e.g. for network, storage or deployment target through a step-by-step deployment wizard. The far more efficient variant in my opinion is making use of the vic-machine utility, a Command Line Interface which is part of the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle.</description>

      <description>When was the last time that you were so much taken by a topic or better by a combination of several, that just by thinking about it your face is filled with enthusiasm?
For me, it&amp;rsquo;s only been a few days ago and it was in one of these afterwork-calls with my well appreciated colleague and friend Michael Gasch where we talked about things we were working on. I had just published my recent post on &amp;ldquo;Monitoring Container VMs with vRealize Operations Manager&amp;rdquo; were I described how I built a dashboard for &amp;amp; with vRealize Operations Manager to monitor the utilization and performance for two of the major objects from vSphere Integrated Containers, the Virtual Container Host (VCH) and the Container-VMs (cVM).</description>

      <description>Based on talks with customers who already made their experiences running containerized applications in test as well as in production and who are using vSphere Integrated Containers for their way to go, I decided to build a dashboard to monitor those workloads (Container-VMs) with VMware¬¥s Cloud Management Solution, vRealize Operations Manager (vR Ops).

The Dashboard Treating Containers as &amp;ldquo;First-Class Citizens&amp;rdquo; is what vSphere Integrated Containers can offer to IT-(Dev)Ops Teams through instantiating a Container-Image as a Virtual Machine.</description>

      <description>Inspired by a recent post from my friend, (Go)Hugo and Git mentor Michael Gasch üòâ, where he describes how he fixed the Hugo Shortcode for Twitter to suppress the default thread view, it came to my mind immediately that I faced a similar issue when I started blogging with the Shortcode which embeds a Youtube-Video into your post.
See how Michael fixed the normal behavior for the Twitter Shortcode {{&amp;lt; tweet &amp;gt;}} here&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I like upgrades! Because mostly they bring cool new features with them or eliminate disturbing issues. In this post I¬¥d like to guide you through the upgrade process of VMware vSphere Integrated Containers  from version v1.3.1 to v1.4.1 which is a major upgrade and also to v1.4.3 which is a minor upgrade.
Thanks Tom Schwaller for reviewing this article.
First of all and this applies to all upgrades, we have to check the compatibility and dependencys with our infrastructure components.</description>

      <title>vSphere Integrated Containers Part IV: docker run a Container-VM</title>

      <description>Now that we¬¥ve become more familiar with the Virtual Container Host, it¬¥s time to run our first Container-VM on it. The following example will show you how easy it is to instantiate an Nginx  Web Server container-image.
We first pull down the image from Docker Hub to our Datastore by using docker -H 192.168.100.222:2376 --tls pull vmwarecna/nginx. You¬¥ll see some running tasks in your vCenter taskbar under Recent Tasks. Validate the downloaded image with docker -H 192.</description>

      <description>In this part I¬¥d like to guide you through the Deployment of a Virtual Container Host aka VCH. I definitely don ÃÅt want to make it a habit to use already written descriptions, but this one described it very well, thus I had like to quote this:
 A VCH is the virtual functional equivalent of a Linux VM running Docker. From a Docker client point of view, the Virtual Container Host looks very similar to a native Docker host.</description>

      <description>In this section, I¬¥d like to give you a walkthrough on how to install the VIC vSphere Client Plug-In for the vCenter Server Appliance. I¬¥m already using the vCenter Server Appliance aka vCSA in Version 6.7.0. In general, it is important to know that a minimum version of vCenter Server 6.5.0d is required to make use of the plug-in.
However! It is also worth to be mentioned that the plug-in is not necessary or a requirement to run VIC as well as for the deployment of a Virtual Container Host aka VCH.</description>

      <description>I¬¥m very keen on everything related to Cloud-Native and all topics around the decoupling of a process from the underlying operating system and as well much more on the infrastructure underneath in order to run those distributed systems, which are the result by the end of the day.
For me personally, it became so present in 2016 for the first time and far more when I decided to work for VMware.</description>
