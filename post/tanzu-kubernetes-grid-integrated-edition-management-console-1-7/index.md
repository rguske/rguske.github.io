Referring to this :point_up_2:, this rebranding was necessary to unify VMware's Kubernetes offerings under the <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu" target="_blank">Tanzu</a> umbrella.

April 16th, version 1.7 of the production-grade Kubernetes-based container solution **VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition** as well as the **VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Management Console** <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Enterprise-PKS/1.7/rn/VMware-Enterprise-PKS-17-Release-Notes.html" target="_blank">went GA</a> and I had the pleasure to introduce the updates for TKGIMC on VMware's official <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/blog" target="_blank">Tanzu Blog</a>:
