And I do not mean that I have to protect my homelab against the next power outage by finally installing a UPS ðŸ˜‰.
 Hello #vExpert&#39;s, I&#39;m looking for a recommendation regarding a ~300W #homelab suitable UPS which has a good price &amp; reliability balance.]]></description>

            </div>I recently had to prepare my homelab for a customer workshop to demo our new Tanzu Runtime &amp; Hybrid Infrastructure Services.

            </div>Since the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) is reaching more and more folks out there and the interest is growing steadily, it is important to validate the integration with other solutions (preferably VMware). At least that&rsquo;s what I thought ðŸ˜‰.
Monitoring in terms of utilization and performance captured my interest. So, how can I monitor not only the appliance (virtual machine) but also the Kubernetes components like the Control Plane (Master), the Node(s) as well as the Pods?]]></description>
