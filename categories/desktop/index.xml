   ^^But why always at the most inappropriate moments?! Just recently it happened to me, that one day before I needed my homelab for a presentation, the vSAN caching disk failed and had to be replaced.
 Nooooooooooo 😩👹 pic.twitter.com/GHELTrPeTn
&mdash; Robert Guske (@vmw_rguske) February 23, 2021   Normally there is no real issue with loosing a caching device in a vSAN cluster but let me put it that way, I&rsquo;m really using all my given 2-node cluster resources and a potential risk of data-loss was calculated.]]></description>

            </div>Introduction In my previous blog post I took A closer look at VMware&rsquo;s Project Nautilus and went through some of the implementation details (Fusion 12). I described how it provides a single development platform on the desktop by enabling you to run, build and manage OCI compliant Containers as well as how easy it is now to instantiate Kubernetes Clusters besides Virtual Machines.
The question This post is intented to answer a question which came into my mind during my work on VMware&rsquo;s Open Source project VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) and as I&rsquo;ve heard of Project Nautilus for the first time.]]></description>

 Ubuntu 18.04 VDI desktop

            </div>Applications In this section I´m going to list a couple of applications which I´m using for my desktop and how you can easily install them from your shell. Of course, it´s not a must and it´s up to you which of them you´d like to install.
Google Chrome https://www.google.com/chrome/

            </div>High ⚡ Way to Shell The operationalization of platforms such as e.g. Kubernetes, or the use of tools for building services or applications such as Docker, requires in both cases the use of the command-line. There are dozens of great plugins, themes and extensions out there to pimp your shell so that it´ll help you to increase velocity as well as useability.
Part III of my series is focused on the Shell and which &ldquo;Highway&rdquo; you can take to have the described tool available at the end.]]></description>
