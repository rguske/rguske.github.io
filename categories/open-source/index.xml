            </div>Introduction With the recent v0.5 release of the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) project, the ability of deploying the core component, the VMware Event Router, via a Helm chart to an existing Kubernetes cluster was introduced. William Lam introduced this and all the other great new features and enhancements in his corresponding blog post. This earned very positive feedback from the community and opens even more doors in terms of flexibility as well as extensibility.]]></description>

            </div>Introduction You may have already heard and read about our latest changes regarding our Kubernetes offering(s) vSphere with Tanzu also former known as vSphere with Kubernetes. Personally, I was totally excited and full of anticipation to make my first hands-on experience with this new deployment option &ndash;&gt; vSphere Networking as an alternative to NSX-T and how HAProxy is doing it&rsquo;s job within this construct. I don&rsquo;t know how you are dealing with installations of the &ldquo;NEW&rdquo; but I always read the documentation first&hellip; &hellip; not &hellip; 🙊 &hellip; but I should!]]></description>

            </div>Community I recently had the pleasure to suppport a member out of the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) Slack Community with his function example contribution to the VEBA project. His name is Bob. He introduced his Powershell/ PowerCLI function on a remote session to me and I was immediately thrilled about what the function does. It covers a use case that one of my customers brought up some time ago when I first introduced VEBA to them.]]></description>

            </div>Since the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) is reaching more and more folks out there and the interest is growing steadily, it is important to validate the integration with other solutions (preferably VMware). At least that&rsquo;s what I thought 😉.
Monitoring in terms of utilization and performance captured my interest. So, how can I monitor not only the appliance (virtual machine) but also the Kubernetes components like the Control Plane (Master), the Node(s) as well as the Pods?]]></description>

   When was the last time that you were so much taken by a topic or better by a combination of several, that just by thinking about it your face is filled with enthusiasm?
For me, it&rsquo;s only been a few days ago and it was in one of these afterwork-calls with my well appreciated colleague and friend Michael Gasch where we talked about things we were working on.]]></description>
