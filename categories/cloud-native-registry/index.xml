            </div>I recently had to prepare my homelab for a customer workshop to demonstrate our new Tanzu Runtime &amp; Hybrid Infrastructure Services which includes e.g. the deployment of a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Cluster on vSphere in a declaritive way (TKG Service), the enterprise cloud native registry Harbor as well as the instantiation of a native Pod on vSphere (vSphere Pod Service).
Figure I: Tanzu Runtime &amp; Hybrid Infrastructure Services" Figure I: Tanzu Runtime &amp; Hybrid Infrastructure Services  My demo was all about the deployment of a application running natively (Native Pod) on vSphere, whose container image I pushed beforehand into my Harbor registry and which in turn was then obtained from there during the application deployment.]]></description>

            </div>The vCenter Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) is still one of my favorite open source projects these days and it is evolving rapidly and continuously through the great work of the two main contributors Michael Gasch and William Lam as well as through the valuable feedback from the community. I´m very proud to be part of the &ldquo;inner circle&rdquo; of folks who meet on a regular basis to discuss everything #VEBA and the keyword here is also feedback.]]></description>
