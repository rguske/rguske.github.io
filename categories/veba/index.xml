            </div>Introduction In my previous blog post I took A closer look at VMware&rsquo;s Project Nautilus and went through some of the implementation details (Fusion 12). I described how it provides a single development platform on the desktop by enabling you to run, build and manage OCI compliant Containers as well as how easy it is now to instantiate Kubernetes Clusters besides Virtual Machines.
The question This post is intented to answer a question which came into my mind during my work on VMware&rsquo;s Open Source project VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) and as I&rsquo;ve heard of Project Nautilus for the first time.]]></description>

            </div>Community I recently had the pleasure to suppport a member out of the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) Slack Community with his function example contribution to the VEBA project. His name is Bob. He introduced his Powershell/ PowerCLI function on a remote session to me and I was immediately thrilled about what the function does. It covers a use case that one of my customers brought up some time ago when I first introduced VEBA to them.]]></description>

            </div>Since the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) is reaching more and more folks out there and the interest is growing steadily, it is important to validate the integration with other solutions (preferably VMware). At least that&rsquo;s what I thought ðŸ˜‰.
Monitoring in terms of utilization and performance captured my interest. So, how can I monitor not only the appliance (virtual machine) but also the Kubernetes components like the Control Plane (Master), the Node(s) as well as the Pods?]]></description>

            </div>The vCenter Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) is still one of my favorite open source projects these days and it is evolving rapidly and continuously through the great work of the two main contributors Michael Gasch and William Lam as well as through the valuable feedback from the community. IÂ´m very proud to be part of the &ldquo;inner circle&rdquo; of folks who meet on a regular basis to discuss everything #VEBA and the keyword here is also feedback.]]></description>
