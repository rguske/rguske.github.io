            </div>Introduction You may have already heard and read about our latest changes regarding our Kubernetes offering(s) vSphere with Tanzu also former known as vSphere with Kubernetes. Personally, I was totally excited and full of anticipation to make my first hands-on experience with this new deployment option &ndash;&gt; vSphere Networking as an alternative to NSX-T and how HAProxy is doing it&rsquo;s job within this construct. I don&rsquo;t know how you are dealing with installations of the &ldquo;NEW&rdquo; but I always read the documentation first&hellip; &hellip; not &hellip; 🙊 &hellip; but I should!]]></description>

            </div>I recently had to prepare my homelab for a customer workshop to demo our new Tanzu Runtime &amp; Hybrid Infrastructure Services. This includes e.g. the deployment of a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Cluster on vSphere (TKG Service), the enterprise cloud native registry Harbor as well as the instantiation of a native Pod on vSphere (vSphere Pod Service).
Figure I: Tanzu Runtime &amp; Hybrid Infrastructure Services" Figure I: Tanzu Runtime &amp; Hybrid Infrastructure Services  My demo was basically all about the deployment of an application running natively (Native Pod) on vSphere, whose container image I pushed beforehand into my Harbor registry and which in turn was then obtained from there during the application deployment.]]></description>

            </div>Introduction The deployment of a Virtual Container Host (VCH) can be done in various ways. One easy way is to use the vSphere-Client (H5) plugin which gives you the ability to configure all necessary parameters e.g. for network, storage or deployment target through a step-by-step deployment wizard. The far more efficient variant in my opinion is making use of the vic-machine utility, a Command Line Interface which is part of the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle.]]></description>

            </div>I like upgrades! Because mostly they bring cool new features with them or eliminate disturbing issues. In this post I´d like to guide you through the upgrade process of VMware vSphere Integrated Containers  from version v1.3.1 to v1.4.1 which is a major upgrade and also to v1.4.3 which is a minor upgrade.
Thanks Tom Schwaller for reviewing this article.
First of all and this applies to all upgrades, we have to check the compatibility and dependencys with our infrastructure components.]]></description>

Quote  A VCH is the virtual functional equivalent of a Linux VM running Docker. From a Docker client point of view, the Virtual Container Host looks very similar to a native Docker host.]]></description>
