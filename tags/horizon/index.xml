            </div>I often thought about writing down my experiences on the topics of Jumphosts, Shell-modifications and useful tools in a series of blog posts, but I hadn´t found the right moment, until I saw the following Tweet, where Alex asked his followers how they get access to a Linux system if they aren´t running Linux on their workstation (locally).
 Ubuntu 18.04 VDI desktop
&mdash; Mark Brookfield (@virtualhobbit) December 28, 2019   Similar to Mark´s answer, I´m also using a VDI (Virtual-Desktop-Infrastructure) desktop for my purposes and I began writing this series&hellip;back in January&hellip;time passed by and due to other projects I worked on and which demanded a lot of my attention (#VEBA 😁), it took a little bit longer to publish them.]]></description>

            </div>Applications In this section I´m going to list a couple of applications which I´m using for my desktop and how you can easily install them from your shell. Of course, it´s not a must and it´s up to you which of them you´d like to install.
Google Chrome https://www.google.com/chrome/

There are dozens of great plugins, themes and extensions out there to pimp your shell so that it´ll help you to increase velocity as well as useability.
Part III of my series is focused on the Shell and which &ldquo;Highway&rdquo; you can take to have the described tool available at the end.]]></description>
