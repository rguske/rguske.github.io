<p>Oh my! I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a three-part series as an outcome of my recent homelab crash, but here we are &#x1f604; Check out my recent posts <a href="https://rguske.github.io/post/database-resurrection-reviving-postgres-on-vmware-vcenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Database Resurrection - Reviving vPostgres DB on VMware vCenter Server</a> and <a href="https://rguske.github.io/post/fixing-vcenter-postgres-archiver-service-dead-replication-slot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Fixing vCenter Postgres Archiver Service - Dead Postgres Replication Slot</a> on my made experiences with recovering the vCenter Server database.</p>
<p>Actually, I thought I was &ldquo;out of the woods&rdquo; with fixiing the broken but unfortunately my Avi Controller was also affected from the outage.</p>]]></description>

<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of modern software architecture, event-driven systems have emerged as a pivotal paradigm, empowering organizations to create highly responsive, scalable, and adaptable applications. Knative stands at the forefront of this revolution, offering a robust and flexible framework for building event-driven architectures (EDA) that seamlessly integrate diverse components, enhance automation, and enable real-time data processing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m evangelizing and supporting the <a href="https://knative.dev/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Knative project</a> for a longer time already. I recently had the pleasure to demonstrate parts of its comprehensive feature set at the great <a href="https://www.containerdays.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">ContainerDays</a> event in beautiful Hamburg, Germany.</p>]]></description>

<p>As technology advances at a rapid pace, the landscape of application development continues to evolve. The demand for agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness has given rise to a new breed of architectures that seamlessly integrate modern cloud-native principles with established traditional workloads. One such paradigm that has gained significant traction is the hybrid application architecture, which combines the power of service-oriented architectures (SOA) with the reliability and versatility of virtual machines (VMs).</p>]]></description>

<p>In this second part, I&rsquo;m going to demonstrate how the <em>Kubernetes Ingress Controller Service (Contour)</em> will be used for serving a vSphere Pod based web-shop application with Ingress functionalities. Also, I&rsquo;m going over the NSX-side of the house in terms of networking, the distributed firewall as well as troubleshooting when using vSphere Pods in TKGS.</p>]]></description>

<p>When VMware <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/04/vsphere-7-new-generation-vsphere.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">released vSphere 7 back in 2020</a>, it was announced that under the hood a lot of architectural efforts flowed into VMware&rsquo;s core platform. These <strong>efforts had to be done in order to embed containers and Kubernetes into vSphere, to unify them with virtual machines as first class citizens</strong>.</p>]]></description>

            </div>The open-source container registry Harbor supports the configuration of webhook endpoints. Harbor notifies the webhook endpoint of certain events that occur in a project. However, the event sent is not delivered as a CloudEvent. By leveraging the power of VEBA/Knative the non-CloudEvent can be send to a webhook function to get transformed in a CloudEvent. By transforming the event, other functions can be subscribed to the new event to ultimately get triggered. As a use case for it, I'm going to describe how ChatOps can be enabled using event-driven automation.]]></description>

    <title>Deploy VMware Tanzu Packages from a private Container Registry</title>

            </div><h2 id="offline-requirements">Offline Requirements</h2>
<p>During a recent Tanzu engagement, my customer wanted to make use of the VMware <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Tanzu Packages</a> to extend the core functionalities of their existing Kubernetes clusters. As a requirement, an offline deployment of the Packages was raised, which in other words means, deployments from their own private container registry. The intention behind it is simple.</p>
<p>All of the Tanzu Packages shown in <em>Table I</em> below are provided by VMware. VMware is ensuring that the images for the Packages are stable, secure and compliant. But in order to deploy a Package, we need unristricted internet acceess to <code>*.projects.registry.vmware.com</code>. To bypass this &ldquo;online&rdquo; requirement, deploying the Packages from a private container registry like <a href="https://goharbor.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Harbor</a> for example, is a typical use case for most clients.</p>]]></description>
