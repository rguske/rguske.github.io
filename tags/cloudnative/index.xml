            </div>Recap and Intro In Part I of my blog series on the Supervisor Services in vSphere with Tanzu (TKGS), I introdcued the overall concept, the idea, the requirements as well as how to register and install a new Supervisor Service in vSphere.
Read HERE
Furthermore, I covered the feature vSphere Pods and how they come to beneficial use for the Supervisor Services.

In this second part, I&rsquo;m going to demonstrate how the Kubernetes Ingress Controller Service (Contour) will be used for serving a vSphere Pod based web-shop application with Ingress functionalities.]]></description>

            </div>To begin with, if you are familiar with vSphere Pods in general, you can skip the first chapter of this post and directly go to the chapter Supervisor Services.
Recap - Embed Containers and Kubernetes into vSphere When VMware released vSphere 7 back in 2020, it was announced that under the hood a lot of architectural efforts flowed into VMware&rsquo;s core platform. These efforts had to be done in order to embed containers and Kubernetes into vSphere, to unify them with virtual machines as first class citizens.]]></description>

            </div>The open-source container registry Harbor supports the configuration of webhook endpoints. Harbor notifies the webhook endpoint of certain events that occur in a project. However, the event sent is not delivered as a CloudEvent. By leveraging the power of VEBA/Knative the non-CloudEvent can be send to a webhook function to get transformed in a CloudEvent. By transforming the event, other functions can be subscribed to the new event to ultimately get triggered. As a use case for it, I'm going to describe how ChatOps can be enabled using event-driven automation.]]></description>

            </div>Offline Requirements During a recent Tanzu engagement, my customer wanted to make use of the VMware Tanzu Packages to extend the core functionalities of their existing Kubernetes clusters. As a requirement, an offline deployment of the Packages was raised, which in other words means, deployments from their own private container registry. The intention behind it is simple.
All of the Tanzu Packages shown in Table I below are provided by VMware.]]></description>
