      <description>Introduction The deployment of a Virtual Container Host (VCH) can be done in various ways. One easy way is to use the vSphere-Client (H5) plugin which gives you the ability to configure all necessary parameters e.g. for network, storage or deployment target through a step-by-step deployment wizard. The far more efficient variant in my opinion is making use of the vic-machine utility, a Command Line Interface which is part of the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine bundle.</description>

      <description>I like upgrades! Because mostly they bring cool new features with them or eliminate disturbing issues. In this post I´d like to guide you through the upgrade process of VMware vSphere Integrated Containers  from version v1.3.1 to v1.4.1 which is a major upgrade and also to v1.4.3 which is a minor upgrade.
Thanks Tom Schwaller for reviewing this article.
First of all and this applies to all upgrades, we have to check the compatibility and dependencys with our infrastructure components.</description>

      <title>vSphere Integrated Containers Part IV: docker run a Container-VM</title>

      <description>Now that we´ve become more familiar with the Virtual Container Host, it´s time to run our first Container-VM on it. The following example will show you how easy it is to instantiate an Nginx  Web Server container-image.
We first pull down the image from Docker Hub to our Datastore by using docker -H 192.168.100.222:2376 --tls pull vmwarecna/nginx. You´ll see some running tasks in your vCenter taskbar under Recent Tasks. Validate the downloaded image with docker -H 192.</description>

      <description>In this part I´d like to guide you through the Deployment of a Virtual Container Host aka VCH. I definitely don ́t want to make it a habit to use already written descriptions, but this one described it very well, thus I had like to quote this:
 A VCH is the virtual functional equivalent of a Linux VM running Docker. From a Docker client point of view, the Virtual Container Host looks very similar to a native Docker host.</description>
