<p>As technology advances at a rapid pace, the landscape of application development continues to evolve. The demand for agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness has given rise to a new breed of architectures that seamlessly integrate modern cloud-native principles with established traditional workloads. One such paradigm that has gained significant traction is the hybrid application architecture, which combines the power of service-oriented architectures (SOA) with the reliability and versatility of virtual machines (VMs).</p>]]></description>

<p>In <a href="https://rguske.github.io/post/vsphere-with-tanzu-supervisor-services-part-i-introduction-and-how-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Part I</a> of my blog series on the <em>Supervisor Services in vSphere with Tanzu (TKGS)</em>, I introduced the overall concept, the idea, the requirements as well as how to register and install a new Supervisor Service in vSphere.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://rguske.github.io/post/vsphere-with-tanzu-supervisor-services-part-i-introduction-and-how-to/#supervisor-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">HERE</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, I covered the feature vSphere Pods and how they come to beneficial use for the Supervisor Services.</p>

<p>In this second part, I&rsquo;m going to demonstrate how the <em>Kubernetes Ingress Controller Service (Contour)</em> will be used for serving a vSphere Pod based web-shop application with Ingress functionalities. Also, I&rsquo;m going over the NSX-side of the house in terms of networking, the distributed firewall as well as troubleshooting when using vSphere Pods in TKGS.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="recap---embed-containers-and-kubernetes-into-vsphere">Recap - Embed Containers and Kubernetes into vSphere</h2>
<p>When VMware <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/04/vsphere-7-new-generation-vsphere.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">released vSphere 7 back in 2020</a>, it was announced that under the hood a lot of architectural efforts flowed into VMware&rsquo;s core platform. These <strong>efforts had to be done in order to embed containers and Kubernetes into vSphere, to unify them with virtual machines as first class citizens</strong>.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Deploy VMware Tanzu Packages from a private Container Registry</title>

            </div><h2 id="offline-requirements">Offline Requirements</h2>
<p>During a recent Tanzu engagement, my customer wanted to make use of the VMware <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Tanzu Packages</a> to extend the core functionalities of their existing Kubernetes clusters. As a requirement, an offline deployment of the Packages was raised, which in other words means, deployments from their own private container registry. The intention behind it is simple.</p>
<p>All of the Tanzu Packages shown in <em>Table I</em> below are provided by VMware. VMware is ensuring that the images for the Packages are stable, secure and compliant. But in order to deploy a Package, we need unristricted internet acceess to <code>*.projects.registry.vmware.com</code>. To bypass this &ldquo;online&rdquo; requirement, deploying the Packages from a private container registry like <a href="https://goharbor.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Harbor</a> for example, is a typical use case for most clients.</p>]]></description>

            </div><h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>Just providing a Kubernetes cluster to an application team is in most cases half of the battle. It&rsquo;s often necessary to provide certain capabilities for e.g. logging or for ingress to those clusters, to ultimately support a production workload. Extending Kubernetes environments with open source solutions, to support the aforementioned capabilities, should provide a decent level of simplicity in terms of deployment and lifecycle management.</p>
<h2 id="a-catalog-of-extensions">A Catalog of Extensions</h2>
<p>Tanzu Mission Control, a VMware Cloud Service (SaaS), is VMware&rsquo;s multi-cloud Kubernetes management platform which provides a centralized management for consistently operating and securing Kubernetes infrastructures and modern applications through a centralized policy management across all deployed and attached Kubernetes clusters.</p>]]></description>
